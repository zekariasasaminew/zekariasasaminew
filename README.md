## 🚀 About Me
I turn ideas into real, usable products.  
At John Deere, I help ship internal tools used by **6,000+ people** across multiple factories in North America and Australia.  
I designed my own major (Bioinformatics) because the catalog didn’t have what I needed.

When I’m not coding:
⚽ Watching Premier League • ♟ Playing chess & pool • 🎮 Gaming
